*section 2    
    -NodeJS is javascript on the server
        -runtime environment
    -runs in conjunction with V8
    -series of methods used in Javascript that are in fact running C++ behind the scenes
    -terminal command cls for clear
    -repl run in terminal
    -global is like window in the browser
    -process is like document, gives you all the methods and properties available to run
        -process.exit() gets you out of the javascript in the terminal
    SUMMARY (2.5)
    -nodejs is javascript on the server via the V8 chrome engine
        -provides C++ bindings to V8, allows you to do things like access the file system
    -(why nodejs?)
        non-blocking I/O model (input output) `querying database for records `it can do other things while waiting (non-blocking)
        -blocking: everything goes in order of steps, not moving to the next until the present is completed
        -non-blocking: not waiting for responses, starts all processes, and runs them IN THE BACKGROUND, with processes running independently of each other
*section 3
    -node module system
        -require function is how we load things to use 
            -importing your own files
                -modules (your .jsFiles; each .js file you create is scoped to itself)
                    -app.js can't load from utils.js, you have to explicitly export all the stuff you want to share from your file with the outside world
                        -this is module.exports = whatEver, which is available as the return value from when you require the file
                        -module.exports = require value elsewhere(?)
            -importing NPM modules
                -good common core functionality for apps
                    -2 step process 
                        -initalize npm within project (npm init)
                        -install necessary modules
                    -node modules  
                        -if not there, run `npm install,` will use contents of two package.json's to make necessary module folder

//////////////////////////////////REDUX//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NPM
    package manager
    npm init - generates package.json   
        -file that holds all dependencies and information about our app 
        -then can npm install various dependencies
            -generates node_modules
                -node generated directory
            -package-lock.json  
                -locked version of package manager
                -alongside regular package.json allows to delete node modules and re-add them 
    global npm packages flag with -g (for gLOBAL)
        -do not need to require in source files, like local npm packages 

//////////////////////////////////REDUX//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

PROCESS.ARGV
    -argument vector
        -allows access for command line arguments, in array 
            -first 2 always same
                1-path to node on machine
                2-path to present file
    YARGS!
        -npm package that makes parsing process.argv easier
            -has options through flags: --help, --version 
            -builderObject
                -we can define all the options we want given commands to support

//////////////////////////////////REDUX//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

JSON!
   -we need to turn our JS objects into strings, so fs can read and use them
        -const toBeJSON = JSON.stringify(notYetJSON);
        -JSON.parse() => takes in JSON data and returns it as a JS object
